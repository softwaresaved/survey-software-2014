# software-survey-2014
R code used to analyse the data collected in 2014 during the Software Survey

## Files

* [`Rmd`](Rmd): Rmd code used to created the clean dataset 

* `analysis_files/figure-html/*`: Figures image in png generated automatically by knitr for the analysis.md
* `data/*`: Datasets used for the analysis in csv format
* `source/*`:  various R script used in the Rmd codes
* `.gitignore`: Ignore the none anonymised dataset
* `analysis.Rmd`: Rmd code containing the analysis of the [cleaned dataset](data/mergedCleaned.csv). It generates the [analysis.html] and [analysis.md] 
* `analysis.html`: Autogenerated report from [analysis.Rmd](analysis.Rmd)
* `analysis.md`: Autogenerated report from [analysis.Rmd](analysis.Rmd)


## Use

The analysis report is already generated and can be seen by opening analysis.md. If you want to reproduce the several steps of the analysis, first launch the [cleaningData.Rmd](RmD/cleaningData.Rmd) and then the [analysis.Rmd](analysis.Rmd) files. 


## Please Note
All the code source and the data are shared except the unanonymised data. In consequences, the script [Rmd/anonymisingRawData.Rmd](Rmd/anonymisingRawData.Rmd) will not work here, it does not have the appropriate csv file but the report of it can be found [here](Rmd/cleaningData.Rmd)
